# Briefly about myself:

I have received education in the field of information technology but during my studies I began to work in public service, in the field that only required my technical and analytical skills.
Despite of my 10-year working experience in the public sector in a completely different field, I have never assumed to give up on my profession. My main goal and challenge is to fulfill career in web development.
I believe, that my education, motivation, diligence and desire to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer. I will not spare time and energy to achieve this goal.
